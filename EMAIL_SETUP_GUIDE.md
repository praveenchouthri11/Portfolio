# 📧 Email Configuration Guide

## 🚀 SMTP Email Notifications Successfully Implemented!

### ✅ What's Now Working:
1. **Contact Form Submissions** → Automatically saved to database
2. **Email to Praveen** → Notification sent to `praveenchouthri@gmail.com`
3. **Auto-reply** → Confirmation email sent to the person who submitted the form
4. **Beautiful HTML Emails** → Professional formatting with your branding

### 📋 Current Status:
- **Database Storage**: ✅ Working (messages saved to MongoDB)
- **Email Notifications**: ⚠️ Ready (needs SMTP credentials)
- **Auto-replies**: ⚠️ Ready (needs SMTP credentials)

## 🔧 To Enable Real Email Sending:

### Step 1: Setup Gmail App Password
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Security** → **2-Step Verification** (enable if not already)
3. **Security** → **App passwords** → Generate password for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character app password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Update Backend Configuration
Edit `/app/backend/.env` file and replace:
```bash
SMTP_USERNAME="praveenchouthri@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
FROM_EMAIL="praveenchouthri@gmail.com"
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend
```bash
cd /app && sudo supervisorctl restart backend
```

## 🧪 Testing:
- **Without SMTP credentials**: Emails are logged but not sent
- **With SMTP credentials**: Real emails are sent to both parties

## 📁 Files Modified:
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Added EmailService class
- `/app/backend/.env` - Added SMTP configuration
- Contact form now triggers both database storage and email sending

## 🔍 Monitoring:
- Check backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log`
- View stored messages: Visit `http://localhost:8001/api/admin/contacts`

## 🎯 Ready to Use:
Once you add your Gmail app password, every contact form submission will:
1. ✅ Save to database 
2. ✅ Email you a notification
3. ✅ Send auto-reply to the sender
4. ✅ Include quick reply links
5. ✅ Show professional branding

**The system is fully implemented and ready to go live! 🚀**
